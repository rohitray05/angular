# angular

Design and implement a user interface that allows a user to enter a loan amount and a loan duration in months which then displays the interest rate and the monthly payment.
The user must be able to enter (at least) the monetary amount by using a slider.  The calculated values should automatically update as the slider is used -without requiring any further interaction by the user.
The loan amount should be between $500 and $5000 and the loan duration between 6 and 24 months.
You should use the following API - https://ftl-frontend-test.herokuapp.com/interest?amount=<amount>&numMonths=<numMonths>
This returns a JSON object with information about the monthly payment and the interest rates.
